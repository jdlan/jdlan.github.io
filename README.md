This open-source project is essentially a software developmental online website or desktop application. My GitHub is being used to build a personalized portfolio consisting of my current and soon to come academic ventures. These ventures so far consist of a repository that tracks and store changes while allowing collaboration if need be. 
Now, the first repository I created I went to GitHub website then I clicked on sign up. After being redirected to the sign-up page I put in my personal information then verified I’m not a robot. The next page prompted me to add personal customizations. Next, I pressed the plus symbol filled out some information then scrolled to the bottom of the page and clicked the button which created the initial repository.
However, to create the cloned version of my initial repository. I went back to the home page then downloaded the desktop application. When it was finished downloading, I had to sign back in. Subsequently the get started page opens and I click the clone button and follow through the prompts until the clone repository was successfully created.
